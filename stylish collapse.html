  <h1>I'm Batman</h1>I told you I was immortal. Oh there are many forms of immortality.<br><br>You fight like a younger man, there's nothing held back. It's admirable, but mistaken.<br><br>If you're good at something, never do it for free.<br><br>Ah yes! I was wondering what would weight first. Your spirit... or your body?<br><br>I had a vision of a world without Batman. The Mob ground out a little profit and the police tried to shut them down one block at a time. And it was so boring. I've had a change of heart. I don't want Mr Reese spoiling everything but why should I have all the fun? Let's give someone else a chance. If Coleman Reese isn't dead in 60 minutes then I blow up a hospital.<br><br>It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me.<br><br>I can't do that as Bruce Wayne... as a man.

This is my city.<br><br>Now choice is yours: exile or death?<br><br>Let me get this straight. You think that your client, one of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world is secretly a vigilante who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands and your plan is to blackmail this person? Good luck.<br><br>Or perhaps he's wondering why someone would shoot a m...
